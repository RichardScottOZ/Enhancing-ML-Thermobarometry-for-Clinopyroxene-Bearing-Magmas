# Enhancing-ML-Thermobarometry-for-Clinopyroxene-Bearing-Magmas-.py-module

Hello and welcome!

This is the series of codes used to calibrate and test the different results from the enhanced clinopyroxene (cpx) and clinoyroxene-liquid (cpx-liq) thermo-barometers presented in Ágreda-López et al. (2024) submitted to Computers and Geosciences journal.

 You will find two folders.  Select the one that better fits your needs:

1. ML_PT_Pyworkflow: contains all you need to use our Python module directly and get your P and T estimates.
3. All_scripts: contains all the scripts we used in the manuscript "Enhancing Machine Learning Thermobarometry for Clinopyroxene-Bearing Magmas", submitted to the Computers and Geosciences journal.

If you have any issues, please write to: maurizio.petrelli@unipg.it, monica.agredalopez@studenti.unipg.it
